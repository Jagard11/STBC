Thanks for downloading the Retro Badger Gaming Kopbayashimaru Sper Patch Version 1.

I am not the creator of any of the included mods, however as a huge Star Trek Bridge Commander and Kobayashimaru fan, I wanted to make it easier for people to install mods.

A lot of people find it tricky, so I wanted to create auto installers, which are compatatble with the GOG version of Bridge Commander.

Included Mods:

USS Voyager A
USS Enterprise J Refit
USS Enterprise F
Galaxy Class X From Hell
Borg Galaxy Class
RBG Galaxy Class Refit
NX Class Pack
Vanguard
Armoured Voyager
Death Star 2
Scorpion 2
Section 31 Defiant
